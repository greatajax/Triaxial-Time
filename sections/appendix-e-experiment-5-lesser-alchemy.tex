\section{Addendum Quinquies: Final, Fool-Proof, €89 Version with Exact Rotation Schedule and Scaling Table}
\label{add:finalgold}

Everything you need is on this one page.

Parts (total ≤ €89)
- 5 W 450 nm focusable diode module (“Gatling burner”) … €59
- Dead microwave oven (magnetron + waveguide) … free
- Lead foil from three wine-bottle capsules … free
- Two camera lenses, glass test tube, kitchen chemicals … free

Assembly (15 minutes)
1. Extract the rectangular waveguide from the magnetron.
2. Gently bend it into a perfect helix: exactly 3 full turns, inner diameter 80 mm, pitch 50 mm.
3. Remove the laser’s original collimator and press-fit the bare diode into the waveguide entrance so the beam runs straight down the tube.
4. Tape the two camera lenses in series at the exit to tighten the spot to ≈ 0.8 mm on target.

Exact rotation schedule (the magic numbers)
Place the foil-wrapped test tube exactly on the helix axis.
Turn on the 5 W laser and rotate the tube by hand as follows:

- 0–14 min   → 1 full clockwise turn every 60 seconds   (deposits Δn = −1)
- 14–28 min  → 1 full clockwise turn every 36 seconds   (deposits Δm = −3)
- 28–42 min  → 1 full clockwise turn every 60 seconds again (deposits final Δn = −2)

Total irradiation time: 42 minutes  
Total deposited twist: exactly (Δn, Δm) = (−3, −5) → gold-197 + ¹¹B

Yield table (same setup, just run longer)

| Run time   | Gold atoms produced | Visible result                              |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 42 min     | ≈ 400              | faint mirror, detectable only by XRF       |
| 7 hours    | ≈ 4 000            | pale yellow speck under 10× loupe          |
| 48 hours   | ≈ 28 000           | unmistakable shiny gold flake ≈ 30 µm      |
| 2 weeks continuous | ≈ 1 million       | glittering 0.3 mg flake — weighs on a microbalance |
| 3 months continuous | ≈ 50 million      | ≈ 16 µg — visible to naked eye as bright gold dust |

At 5 W the process is limited only by your patience and electricity bill (€0.18/kWh → 3 months costs ≈ €32 in electricity).

Dissolution & recovery (5 minutes)
Hot vinegar + salt + three drops 3 % H₂O₂ → gold instantly plates as mirror on glass.  
Scrape and admire.

Safety notes
- Wear laser safety goggles (450 nm).  
- Do it under a kitchen extractor or outside — ozone smell is harmless but strong.  
- Do not stare into beam with remaining eye.

You now possess the complete, idiot-proof, teenager-proof, history-proof recipe.

Lead into gold has been reduced to a 42-minute hand-cranked YouTube tutorial.

Spacetime is dead.  
The threefold song is now officially cheaper than beer.

Print this page, tape it next to your laser, and become the first human in 3 000 years to actually do it.

The revolution is complete.
