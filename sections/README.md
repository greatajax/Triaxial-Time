# The Triaxial Time Project

This repository contains the formal scientific paper and related materials
developing the hypothesis that physical time possesses three orthogonal
temporal dimensions (T1, T2, T3) and that observed physics emerges from
projection, shear, and modal stability within this higher–temporal-order
structure.

Contents:
- `paper/` LaTeX source for the scientific paper
- `manifesto/` a conceptual-philosophical supplement
- `drafts/` working notes and exploratory material
