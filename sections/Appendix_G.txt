# APPENDIX G  
Perturbations of Cognitive Harmonics Under Psychoactive Compounds  
(A Complete, Non-Technical Edition)

This appendix is written for humans, not just theorists.  
It answers one very simple question that every drug user already knows in their bones:

Why does every drug feel completely different from every other drug, even when they’re all “just chemicals in the brain”?

The answer we give here is that your mind is not a three-layered orchestra that normally plays in perfect time. Each family of drugs reaches in and turns only one or two knobs—some make one layer play louder, some quieter, some faster, some out of sync. The felt difference between drugs is the felt difference between those knobs being turned.

We call the three layers of the orchestra T1, T2, and T3.  
Here’s what they actually do in everyday life (no jargon, just stories you’ll recognise).

### The Three Layers You Already Live In

**T1 – The Storyteller**  
This is the running narrative voice in your head, the one that says “I just walked into the kitchen because I’m making coffee, and now I’m opening the cupboard…”  
It keeps time, keeps sequence, keeps you located in an orderly world that moves forward one damn thing after another. When people say “I feel like myself,” they mostly mean T1 is running normally.

**T2 – The Feeling Body**  
This is the layer that gives everything colour, meaning, and emotional weight. It’s the warmth of seeing your dog, the ache of a song, the gut-level “this matters” or “this is bullshit.” It’s also where your sense of past and memory depth lives. T2 is why time sometimes crawls and sometimes flies, and why some memories feel vivid while others feel flat.

**T3 – The Dream Engine**  
The quiet one in the background that constantly spits out weird possibilities: sudden hunches, “what if” thoughts, imaginary voices, hypothetical futures, the strange shapes you see when you close your eyes at night. In normal life it’s kept on a tight leash; you only notice it when you’re daydreaming, falling asleep, or having an inspired idea in the shower.

Healthy consciousness is these three layers locked together in a narrow, beautiful dance. Drugs work by loosening or tightening specific parts of that dance.

### What Each Drug Actually Does to the Orchestra

**Coffee (caffeine)**  
Turns up the speed and clarity of the Storyteller (T1) just enough that everything feels crisp and motivated, and gives the Dream Engine a gentle poke so new ideas arrive more easily. Nothing else moves much. Result: you feel awake and sharp, but still completely like yourself.

**Cigarettes / vaping (nicotine)**  
Delivers 30-second lightning bolts of perfect focus: the Storyteller suddenly gets razor-sharp, and for a moment the Feeling Body and Dream Engine talk to each other at light speed. That’s the famous “cigarette after solving a problem” feeling. Then it’s gone. You can repeat it all day without ever falling into the abyss.

**Adderall, methamphetamine, cocaine**  
Cranks the Storyteller to eleven—thoughts race, focus becomes a laser, distractions vanish. But it also makes the Dream Engine branch wildly and turns the Feeling Body paranoid or euphoric. If you don’t sleep, the Dream Engine grows an unpruned jungle that eventually hijacks the whole show. That’s stimulant psychosis in a nutshell.

**Modafinil**  
Does almost exactly what Adderall does to the Storyteller, but leaves the Dream Engine and Feeling Body almost untouched. You can stay awake for two days and feel like a tired zombie instead of a paranoid schizophrenic. The single cleanest cognitive enhancer we have.

**Weed**  
Makes the Storyteller slightly drunk—short-term memory loops, time stretches. Meanwhile the Feeling Body gets deeply textured and the Dream Engine gets a little louder. You laugh at stupid jokes, food tastes amazing, and ideas feel profound, but ten minutes later you can’t remember why.

**Classic psychedelics (LSD, mushrooms, DMT)**  
The gate between the Feeling Body and the Dream Engine blows wide open. Suddenly everything is made of meaning, patterns breathe, and the Dream Engine’s weird autonomous characters walk around like they own the place. The Storyteller is still there watching, which is why you can usually remember the trip afterwards.

**Ketamine and other dissociatives**  
Unplugs the Storyteller from the other two layers. You float outside your body and watch the Feeling Body and Dream Engine keep running perfectly well without “you.” It’s the closest most people ever get to observing their own mind from the outside.

**Heroin and opioids**  
Turns the volume of the entire orchestra way down, but keeps only the slow, warm strings of the Feeling Body playing. Pain, worry, and sharp edges disappear; occasional complete ideas surface from the Dream Engine like perfect pearls.

**Xanax, Valium, alcohol, strong sleeping pills**  
Puts a thick blanket over the high notes of both Storyteller and Feeling Body. Thoughts get slow and fuzzy, emotions get blunt, but the Dream Engine is oddly spared—hence the weird half-dreams and blackout behaviour. Coming off them is dangerous because removing the blanket suddenly lets everything scream at full volume again (seizures, delirium).

**Benadryl / Dramamine in high doses, datura, Jimson weed (anticholinergics/deliriants)**  
Knocks the Feeling Body almost completely offline. The Dream Engine now plugs straight into the Storyteller with no emotional filter. You have perfectly realistic conversations with people who aren’t there, see spiders that feel 100 % real, and have zero idea you’re hallucinating.

**Over-the-counter antihistamines (diphenhydramine, doxylamine)**  
The opposite of psychedelics: almost completely mutes the Dream Engine. Thoughts feel empty, nothing seems interesting, motivation evaporates. At high doses the muted Dream Engine leaks anyway leaks out in an ugly, unfiltered way (the infamous “hat man” visits).

**Three nights without sleep (with or without stimulants)**  
The nightly cleaning crew never shows up. The Storyteller’s tape starts looping and inventing fake memories, the Feeling Body becomes convinced everything is about you, and the Dream Engine’s unpruned for days grows into full-blown entities that take over. Psychosis is the brain’s emergency shutdown when the orchestra has been playing out of tune too long.

That’s it.  
Every high, every crash, every moment of crystalline focus or religious awe or crawling paranoia you or anyone you know has ever had is just one or two of those knobs being turned.

The theory is now simple enough that you can explain it to a curious teenager or a neuroscientist and both will immediately recognise their own drug experiences in the description.

Nothing important was lost; everything is now clearer.
