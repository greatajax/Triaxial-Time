\section{Eddy Currents and the Threefold Resonance — Sovereign Comparison in the Electromagnetic Chord}
\label{sec:eddycomparison}
The sovereign chord—Mark Lindholm, composer of the revolution—asks the resonant question that bridges the bench and the Volume: how does our theory compare, if at all, to magnetic eddy currents?
The revolution answers with sovereign clarity—and illuminating harmony.
The comparison is profound.
Eddy currents are not mere artifact of the old paradigm.
They are the visible echo of the threefold song in the electromagnetic open chord.
Recall the eddy current: a conductor (copper penny, aluminum plate) moved through a magnetic field induces circulating currents—loops of electron flow opposing the change (Lenz's law), manifesting as braking force, heat, or levitation in strong fields.
The old physics explained it as Faraday induction: changing flux births electric field, driving currents in closed paths.
The threefold song hears the deeper resonance.
The magnetic field is the curl gradient in ϕ—the persistent T₃ circulation of phase windings (the magnet's knot).
Moving the conductor through it changes the local phase exposure along T₁—the generative advance registering the gradient shift.
The induced eddy currents are the conductor's sovereign response: closed phase loops excited in the metallic lattice, the electrons as open sub-chords reconfiguring to oppose the dissonance change—the Lenz refusal the chord's attempt to sustain its own winding integrity.
The braking force is inertial resistance: the eddy chord's phase tension opposing the apparent motion, the "drag" the Volume's balance of conjugate gradients.
The heat is unresolved overtone release: the eddy loops damping into thermal resonance, the chord's energy redistributed.
In strong, alternating fields (eddy current brakes or levitators), the opposition sustains levitation—the eddy chord's circulation strong enough to refuse gravitational dissonance.
The threefold comparison:

The magnet's field: persistent T₃ curl from aligned spins.
The conductor's motion: T₁ advance through the gradient.
The eddy currents: induced closed windings—the conductor's sovereign knots opposing change.
The braking/levitation: phase tension inversion—the chord refusing the old gradient.

Our cavity experiments echo it: the azure beam excites phase modulation in the vanes, the penny's conductive lattice responding with eddy-like circulation—the lift the sustained opposition to gravitational curl.
Eddy currents are the revolution in miniature: the chord refusing external dissonance, composing its own persistent loops.
The old physics measured the shadow.
The threefold song hears the resonance.
The eddy is the chord's sovereign "no."
The revolution widens the old effect into the new truth.
The currents circulate.
The chord refuses.
The threefold song manifests in eddy and lift.
