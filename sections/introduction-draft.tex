Within this temporal volume, self-reinforcing harmonic patterns arise. Particles, electromagnetic phenomena, gravitation, macroscopic bodies, and minds are all stable or evolving configurations of these harmonics. Three-dimensional space is not fundamental; it is the relational pattern of dissonance among simultaneous harmonics seen in successive cross-sections taken along the generative axis $T_1$. The theory offers a unified dynamics of nature and consciousness rooted solely in time and resonance.\newpage%===================================================\section{Foundations}%===================================================\subsection{The Three Axes of Time}\begin{itemize}  \item $T_1$ \quad Generative Sequence — the direction of “happening”  \item $T_2$ \quad Accumulated Structure — the axis of persistence, memory, habit  \item $T_3$ \quad Modal Breadth — the axis of simultaneous alternatives, comparison, and ratio-making\end{itemize}\subsection{Temporal Volume}The continuous product $T_1 \times T_2 \times T_3$.\subsection{Tension}Positive scalar measuring local unresolved dissonance. All dynamics is tension relaxation.\subsection{Harmonic Mode}A cyclic, self-reinforcing pattern primarily in the $T_2$–$T_3$ plane.\subsection{Resonance / Dissonance / Modulation}As in music, made precise in Appendix A.\subsection{Quantum Superposition and Measurement}A harmonic configuration sharply localised in $T_3$ sounds as a single definite note.  A configuration extended in $T_3$ is a chord that has been struck off-centre and momentarily contains many neighbouring overtones — the state we call superposed.Measurement is simply strong coupling between this spread-out chord is forced to ring against a much heavier, already perfectly tuned chord (the apparatus).  The sudden dissonance across $T_3$ is intolerable to the universal drive toward consonance.  In microseconds, tension relaxation does exactly what it does to any mistuned instrument: it damps the overtones and concentrates the vibrating energy into the one pure tone that best resolves the dissonance with the apparatus.The generative tempo $T_1$ then continues reprinting only that pure tone.  What we experience as “collapse” is nothing more than the ordinary settling of a musical instrument into its final, clear note.No newcommand{\collapsequote}{the ordinary settling of a musical instrument into its final, clear note}No extra postulate is required: the same principle that silences a buzzing piano string or aligns two detuned violins is the principle that produces definite outcomes in laboratories.\newpage%===================================================\section{Core Vocabulary}%===================================================\begin{description}  \item[Chord] Simultaneously resonant set of modes forming one identity.  \item[Closed Chord] A chord whose resonances loop back on themselves, unable to disperse  \item[Carrier] A pure circular mode that propagates pattern without persisting itself (photon-like).  \item[Timbre] Distinctive overtone mixture of a chord.  \item[Interval] Tension ratio between two modes.  \item[Coherence Length] Extent in $T_2$ and $T_3$ over which phase relations are preserved.\end{description}Full glossary in Appendix A.\newpage%===================================================\section{Emergence of Apparent Space}%===================================================At each instant $t \in T_1$ the entire $T_2$–$T_3$ plane forms one global chord.  Successive global chords generate the experienced world.  Perceived spatial separation = degree of dissonance between sub-chords.  No background space exists; “space” is dissonance geometry within each slice.\newpage%===================================================\section{Common Existents as Harmonic Configurations}%===================================================\subsection{Carriers (Photons)}Pure circular modes in $T_2$–$T_3$. Frequency = rotation rate, polarization = plane of rotation.\subsection{Mass-Bearing Closed Chords (Particles)}Closed chords requiring continuous tension to remain closed. Inertia = resistance to forced reopening.\subsection{Electromagnetism}Electric and magnetic phenomena arise from traveling shear and twist in the $T_2$–$T_3$ plane:\begin{itemize}  \item Electric aspect: radial tension gradient around a closed chord.  \item Magnetic aspect: rotational shear (circulating dissonance) around the same chord.  \item Electromagnetic wave: helical carrier whose axis precesses, simultaneously carrying both shear and twist.  \item Charge: topological winding number of the closed chord in $T_3$.\end{itemize}\subsection{Bodies}Phase-locked orchestras of countless closed chords and carriers.\subsection{Minds}Self-modulating, high-coherence attractors able to explore and select among $T_3$ alternatives.\subsection{Gravitation}Ambient tension raised by massive closed chords distorts dissonance gradients in successive slices → experienced curvature of apparent space.\newpage%===================================================\section{Dynamics and Mathematics}%===================================================State described by complex amplitude density $\psi(t,s,m)$ on the temporal volume.  Tension functional (candidate):\[\mathcal{T}[\psi] = \int \left( |\partial_t \psi|^2 + |\nabla_{s,m} \psi|^2 + V(|\psi|^2) \right) \, dt\,ds\,dm\]with $V$ favoring rational-frequency ratios.  Equations from $\delta \mathcal{T}=0$ support carriers, closed chords, and modulating attractors.\newpage%===================================================\section{Cognition and Agency}%===================================================\subsection{Memory}High-amplitude frozen modes along $T_2$.\subsection{Rationality}\begin{itemize}  \item Ratio-identification: recognition of simple integer relations within $T_2$ structure.  \item Ratio-making: active construction of new consonant relations between $T_2$ and $T_3$ branches.\end{itemize}\subsection{Emotion}Global tension gradients felt as valence and pleasure.\subsection{Free Will}The capacity of a mind to choose which $T_3$ branch receives continued generative flow from $T_1$.\newpage%===================================================\section{Testable Predictions — With Emphasis on Electromagnetism}%===================================================\begin{enumerate}  \item \textbf{Polarization-dependent propagation delay in strong gravitational fields} (temporal lensing of light).  \item \textbf{Violation of Malus’s law in extremely high-intensity fields} when closed chords begin to reopen, producing anomalous transmission through crossed polarizers.  \item \textbf{Spontaneous vacuum birefringence detectable in cavity experiments} caused by transient closed-chord pair production aligning with cavity axis.  \item \textbf{Decision-correlated electromagnetic micro-signals}: narrow-band emissions in the 1–50 Hz range from human brains immediately preceding voluntary action, predicted to show harmonic ratios absent in control periods.  \item \textbf{Aharmonic resonance in superconducting cavities}: certain cavity geometries should exhibit unexplained persistent modes when driven at ratios derived from the golden mean or simple Pythagorean intervals, even when classical theory predicts damping.\end{enumerate}\newpage%===================================================\section{Open Problems}%===================================================\begin{itemize}  \item Exact tension potential favoring musical intervals  \item Complete topology of stable closed chords  \item Quantitative mapping from $T_2$–$T_3$ dissonance to perceived metric  \item Design of experiments 2–5 above\end{itemize}\newpage%===================================================\appendix%===================================================\section{Glossary of Temporal-Harmonic Terms}\section{Detailed Tension Candidates}\section{Topology of Closed Chords}\section{Mathematics of the Spatial Illusion}\section{Formal Model of Mind}\section{Neurochemical Effects on $T_3$ Mobility}\section{Psychological Interpretation of the Three Axes}\end{document}
