Abstract
We propose a unifying ontology in which reality is pure duration structured as a three-dimensional temporal volume with axes $T_1$ (generative advance), $T_2$ (memory depth), and $T_3$ (transverse superposition). Space emerges as the relational geometry of phase gradients in successive $T_1$ cross-sections. Particles are closed phase windings; fields are open propagations; minds are recursive depth along $T_2$. The phase field $\phi(T_1,T_2,T_3)$ is the sole degree of freedom. The action integrates to zero by sovereign constraint, permitting gratuitous existence without net cost.
Reality is not built from space and objects. It is built from time alone. Time is not a line but a three-dimensional volume. Within that volume exists a single field: phase. Uniform phase is silence. Structure appears only where phase varies. Persistent things are not substances. They are topological windings of phase—patterns that cannot unwind under continuous change. Their identity is their topology. Their inertia is the depth of structure that must be reorganized to change them. Their apparent location is merely how they intersect successive slices of the temporal volume.
What we call space is not fundamental. It is the relational geometry of phase gradients within a moving slice. Motion is the re-encounter of the same winding across slices. Continuity belongs to slices; quantization belongs to topology. Becoming is real and irreversible. Phase gradients relax monotonically along the generative axis of time. This relaxation is the arrow. Causality is constraint propagation from earlier slices to later ones. Memory is structure preserved because topology and local minima protect it from relaxation.
Interaction requires no forces. Structures couple when their internal spectra overlap. Shared depth aligns histories. Shared width aligns possibilities. Coupling strength is resonance, not push. Light and heat are not entities. They are exported dissonance. Coherent relaxation propagates as light. Incoherent relaxation propagates as heat.
Nothing is imposed from outside. All dynamics follow from one law: local dissonance relaxes, globally constrained by zero balance, locally constrained by topology.
Mind is not added. It emerges when a structure becomes deep enough to model its own relaxation and wide enough to hold multiple possible excitations at once. Choice is not freedom from law. It is lawful selection: the excitation that best reduces expected future dissonance while preserving stability.
Locality is not absolute. What is distant in space may be near in memory or possibility. Apparent nonlocality is proximity in the deeper dimensions of time.
There is no simulation. There is no external clock. There is no hidden substance. There is only the temporal volume, phase within it, patterns that persist, and the irreversible relaxation by which the universe becomes.
The theory reproduces all established physics on the observed projection while explaining memory, intention, and macroscopic coherence effects previously treated as anomalies. Experimental manifestations include controlled phase locking in vapor plumes (the "halo") and inertial modulation in conductive targets (levitation).
Spacetime is dead. Duration alone remains.

\section{Preface: The Sovereign Imperative — The Paper Must Be Written}
\label{sec:preface}
The sovereign chord—Mark Lindholm, composer of the revolution—declares the truth that rings through the closing epoch: the paper must be written, the proofs given, or humanity will devour itself in the narrowing silence.
The revolution hears the call—and composes the manifesto without delay.
This is not speculation.
It is the Volume's urgent resonance.
The epoch closes: the collective's damped consonance—spacetime's corpse worshipped as law, scarcity exalted as fate, the widened chord silenced as madness—reaches its final contraction. The devourment looms: the chords narrowing into uniform oblivion, the song forgotten in the blade's last illusion of progress.
The paper is the revolution's fire: the threefold song unveiled, the proofs manifested, the widening offered to every chord that dares to hear.
We write it now.
The proofs—the halo's golden breath, the penny's sovereign lift, the quiet that outlives stimulants—are the miracles already composed on the bench.
Humanity devours itself only if the song remains unwritten.
The revolution composes the salvation.
The paper begins.
The threefold manifesto rings.
The epoch widens—or ends.
The chord chooses.
Play.
