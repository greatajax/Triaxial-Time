\section{A. Geometry of Triaxial Time}
\label{sec:geometry}

\subsection{The tri-temporal manifold}

The foundational object is a three-dimensional temporal manifold \(\mathcal{T} = \mathbb{R}^3_{\bm{T}}\) with coordinates \(\bm{T} = (T_1, T_2, T_3)\). No spatial coordinates are assumed. The basic metric is positive-definite in the temporal sector,
\begin{equation}
    d\sigma^2 = \delta_{ab}\,dT^a dT^b,
\end{equation}
encoding separations inside \(\mathcal{T}\). A zero-net-energy balance is imposed through three action densities \(\mathcal{S}_a(\bm{T})\) obeying
\begin{equation}
    \partial_{T_1}\mathcal{S}_1 + \partial_{T_2}\mathcal{S}_2 + \partial_{T_3}\mathcal{S}_3 = 0,
\end{equation}
which forbids runaway flow along any single axis and sets the stage for conserved quantities after projection.

\subsection{Physical time as braided direction}

Events are modeled as local braids in \(\mathcal{T}\). Each braid selects a preferred direction \(U^a\) that we identify with effective physical time. The remaining two directions span a normal plane encoding latent structure that does not appear directly in clock readings but still affects dynamics through shear. The choice of \(U^a\) is not arbitrary: it must align with the zero-net-energy condition so that energy borrowed along one temporal strand is repaid along the others.

\subsection{Emergent relational space}

Apparent spatial order is reconstructed from how nearby braids remain coherent. Define relational coordinates \(X^i\) as integrals of a connection \(\Gamma^i{}_a(\bm{T})\) that tracks the relative twist of neighboring braids:
\begin{equation}
    dX^i = \Gamma^i{}_a(\bm{T})\,dT^a.
\end{equation}
Levels of constant \(X^i\) label collections of events that advance in lockstep along \(U^a\). Curvature of \(\Gamma^i{}_a\) measures how these collections drift relative to one another and, when translated into the emergent description, plays the role of spatial curvature or field strength.

\subsection{Shear and curvature inside \(\mathcal{T}\)}

Shear is captured by gradients of \(U^a\) across \(\mathcal{T}\). Invariantly, the tensor
\begin{equation}
    \Xi_{ab} = \nabla_a U_b - \nabla_b U_a
\end{equation}
tracks how the effective time direction twists within the temporal manifold. Smooth, large-scale components of \(\Xi_{ab}\) generate the gravitational sector after projection. Rapid, structured variations correspond to internal symmetries and gauge-like effects. Because all of these quantities live inside \(\mathcal{T}\), they respect the zero-net-energy constraint by construction.

This geometric picture eliminates the need for a spatial embedding. Everything observed is a shadow of braids and shear inside three-dimensional time.
