\begin{abstract}
We explore a model in which the primitive structure underlying physics is not a
single time parameter but a three-dimensional temporal manifold, with axes
denoted \(T_1, T_2, T_3\). The observed \(3+1\)-dimensional spacetime of
standard physics is treated as a membrane embedded in this higher-order
temporal structure. Local physical processes appear as projections of
higher-dimensional temporal modes onto the membrane. We show that this
construction can reproduce the kinematics of special relativity, accommodate a
general-relativistic limit in the presence of curvature and shear of the
membrane, and admit a natural place for probabilistic quantum dynamics and
mental/intentional phenomena as extended structures along \(T_2\) and \(T_3\).
We emphasize causal consistency, mathematical legality, and empirical
non-contradiction, and we identify concrete phenomenological consequences that
could, in principle, distinguish a triaxial temporal ontology from standard
monotemporal frameworks.
