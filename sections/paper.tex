\begin{abstract}
We advance a three-time framework in which no background space is assumed. Reality is built from a triad of temporal axes \(\bm{T} = (T_1, T_2, T_3)\) whose braiding generates all observed structure. Physical space, fields, and particles emerge as effective descriptions of persistent knots in this temporal flow. A zero-net-energy constraint across the temporal axes guarantees that forward and backward flows balance, preventing runaway modes and anchoring conservation laws. The paper reformulates kinematics, quantum behavior, and cognition as projections of these braided temporal volumes, isolates the empirical hooks that could falsify the picture, and provides a disciplined roadmap for completing the proofs.
