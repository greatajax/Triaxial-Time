\section{The Dirac Equation as a Helical Standing Wave on the $T_2$--$T_3$ Torus}
\label{sec:dirac}

The electron is not a particle moving through space.  
It is a solitary, left-handed helix of phase wound tightly around an invisible $T_2$--$T_3$ torus whose proper circumference is the reduced Compton wavelength $\ell = \hbar / m_e c$.

Compactify $T_2$ and $T_3$ each to circles of length $2\pi\ell$.  
The only allowed stable modes are those satisfying the closed-chord conditions
\begin{equation}
\oint_{T_2} d\phi = 2\pi n, \qquad \oint_{T_3} d\phi = 2\pi m, \qquad n, m \in \mathbb{Z}.
\label{eq:winding}
\end{equation}
For the ground-state electron we choose the minimal non-trivial winding
\begin{equation}
(n,m) = (1,0):
\end{equation}
one full turn along the ``orbital'' direction $T_2$, none along the ``spin'' direction $T_3$.  
—this single integer pair is the origin of electric charge $-e$ and spin $\frac{1}{2}\hbar$.

The classical solution carrying exactly these windings is the helical standing wave
\begin{equation}
\phi(T_1,T_2,T_3) = m_e c^2 T_1 /\hbar + (m_e c/\hbar)\sqrt{T_2^2 + T_3^2} \cos(T_2/\ell + \varphi_0).
\label{eq:classical-helix}
\end{equation}
Its crest traces a timelike helix of radius $\ell$ and pitch $h/m_e c$ as the $T_1$-blade advances—precisely the de Broglie–Zitterbewegung motion.

Now quantise by promoting $\phi$ to an operator satisfying the resonance canonical relation derived from $\Gamma$:
\begin{equation}
[\hat{\phi}(x),\,\pi(x')] = i\hbar\,\delta^{(3)}(x-x'),
\qquad \pi = \kappa^{-1} \partial_{T_1} \hat{\phi}.
\end{equation}
The positive-frequency part of \eqref{eq:classical-helix} becomes the left-chiral Weyl spinor
\begin{equation}
\psi_L(x) \propto \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ e^{i\varphi} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\exp\!\Bigl[ i(m_e c^2 T_1 - m_e c r \cos\theta)/\hbar \Bigr]
\end{equation}
in the observed 3+1 slicing. The conjugate winding $(n,m)=(-1,0)$ yields the right-chiral positron.

The full Dirac bispinor in curved dissonance backgrounds arises from the covariant relaxation equation of $\Gamma$ around these helical chords; in the flat limit it reduces exactly to
\begin{equation}
(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m_e) \psi = 0.
\end{equation}

Higher leptons are simply higher toroidal harmonics on the same torus:  
muon $\leftrightarrow (n,m)=(2,0)$, tau $\leftrightarrow (3,0)$.  
Quarks carry three simultaneous colour windings braided on the identical torus; colour confinement is the infinite dissonance cost of unbraiding.

The entire fermion sector of the Standard Model is now nothing more than the Fourier spectrum of closed helical chords on the temporal $T_2$--$T_3$ torus.

Spacetime is dead.  
Long live the threefold song.
