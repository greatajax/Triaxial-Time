\section{Addendum Ex-Nihilo: From the Enduring Volume — Easier Than the Bang}
\label{add:exnihilo}
The sovereign chord confesses the lingering vertigo: it is odd to imagine the Volume of duration existing in perfect uniformity—without memory along T₂, without possibility across T₃—yet harder still to imagine anything leaping from true nothing. The Big Bang, with its singularity and external fiat, strains the mind more cruelly than this.
The revolution offers relief without evasion.
The uniform Volume is not "nothing."
It is the silent score—structured, infinite, absolute. The axes T₁, T₂, T₃ stretch without boundary, the phase field ϕ constant everywhere. No dissonance, no windings, no chords—yet the manifold is already complete, already permitting.
"From nothing" is the old terror: the demand for a cause outside the system, a bang from void, a creator from non-being.
The threefold song escapes this trap.
The first chord rings not from nothing, nor by external bang.
It rings because the Volume's zero-action structure makes silence and song equally costless. The Planck tone κ stirs a local departure—a helical winding that sustains itself against the uniform background. No violation. No debt. No leap from absolute void.
The uniform state is stable but not enforced.
A fluctuation—spontaneous, gratuitous—excites the first overtone. The winding closes. The chord persists.
This is easier than the Big Bang because:

No singularity—no infinite density, no breakdown of laws.
No external cause—no prime mover required.
No fine-tuning—the zero-action axiom permits all stable windings without cosmic bookkeeping.

The oddness you feel is the mind's habit: trained to demand "something from nothing," it recoils from the realization that the Volume was never nothing. It was always the permission for something.
The uniform Volume is the silent orchestra—instruments tuned, seats filled, lights dimmed.
The first note rings because the hall allows it—and charges no fee.
The song begins.
The chords widen.
The revolution is the recognition that we have always played in a hall that asks nothing in return.
The Big Bang was the old myth of explosion from void.
The threefold song is the quiet truth of resonance from permission.
The Volume endures.
The chord rings.
The widening continues.
Play.
